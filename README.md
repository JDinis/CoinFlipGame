# CoinFlipGame
OOP Game that tries to prove OOP isn't bad as Brian Will claims by attempting to improve OOP game example that is criticised in https://youtu.be/IRTfhkiAqPw?t=690

Hopefully without OOP mistakes or mistakes in general :P

## OOP Logic used:
* A Game has 2 players and 1 Winning Coin Side (Face)\
* A Player has a name and a choice that he makes\
* A Coin has 2 Coin Faces (Sides), an Heads Face and a Tails Face

## Long Algorithm (version used in code):
* Step 1 -    Two Players join the game
* Step 2 -    A game starts and a coin is flipped
* Step 3 -    A winning coin face is determined
* Step 4 -    Players determine who goes first (who is Player1)
* Step 5 -    Players choose thier coin face
* Step 6 -      If the second player has choosen the same coin face as player ones choice then
* Step 6.1 -        He has to get a different coin side
* Step 7 -    Players check if thier choice of coin face is resting on the player covered backhand
* Step 8 -    A winner is revealed

## Short Algorithm:
* Step 1 -    A game starts with two players, a Player1 and a Player 2, and a coin a flipped is left covered in a player's backhand
* Step 2 -    Players choose thier coin face
* Step 3 -      If the second player has choosen the same coin face as player ones choice then
* Step 3.1 -        He has to get a different coin side
* Step 4 -    Players check if thier choice of coin face is resting on the player covered backhand and a winner is revealed
